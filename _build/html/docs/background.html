<p>We interact with computers in many different ways. I assume, most of you
are very familiar with passing on the commands and your wishes to your
computer using a keyboard, mouse, touchpad or touch-sensitive screen,
and maybe there are some of you who enjoy giving orders to Cortana or
Siri using speech recognition systems. The most common way to interact
with personal computers is called a <strong>graphical user interface</strong>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a>). The
actions in a GUI are usually performed through direct manipulation of
the graphical elements (e.g. by clicking a mouse on an icon, dragging a
folder to a trach bin, etc.).</p>
<p>GUIs are very popular due to their steep learning curve (think about it,
even my grandmother learned how to use Facebook and smartphone), but
this comes with some drawbacks. GUIs are not ideal for delivering a
complex set of tasks and instructions to a computer. Imagine that for
one of your projects you have to merge more than a thousand different
consensus sequences of mtDNA into one file. You might click and open
each of those files and copy-paste fasta sequences from them to a new
single file. This would take you hours, and you would be likely to make
a mistake in this boring, tedious and repetitive task. Thus using a GUI,
would not make our life easier, but rather complicated and frustrating.
And this is why biologists must take a step outside of their comfort
zone and learn how to take advantage of the <strong>command-line interface</strong>
(<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>)! CLIs, in
contrast to GUIs, require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard,
they can allow us to automate and perform repetitive and boring tasks
easily and fast by
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language">scripting</a>. The
software that handles the command-line interface is called
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)">shell</a>, also commonly
referred to as a command language interpreter. Strictly speaking, the
term <strong>shell</strong> refers to any program that constitutes the
user-interface, including fully graphically oriented ones, and
command-line interpreters. However, most commonly this term is used to
refer only to software that constitutes CLI.</p>
<p><img alt="GUI vsCLI" src="docs/C:/Users/vladi/Nextcloud/Nowick_Lab/Master_course_Bioinformatics_for_Biologists/SoSe2020/Linux-Cli-vs-Gui.png" />{width=”100%”}</p>
<p>Operating systems (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a>)
implement a command-line interface in a
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)">shell</a> for interactive
access to operating system functions or services. The most popular Unix
shell is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">Bash</a> which
is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix, and in most
packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.</p>
<p>As we mentioned before using the shell requires some effort and time to
learn. In contrast to a GUI that presents a menu like choices from which
we can select the desired one, CLI choices are not automatically
presented to us, and thus we have to learn commands and their calling
<em>syntax</em>, and we have to understand concepts about the shell-specific
scripting language. Learning commands is similar to learning vocabulary
from a foreign language. The more words and grammar we know the better
we would be in expressing our thoughts in a foreign language, the same
applies to the programming languages.</p>
<p>The grammar of a shell allows us to combine multiple commands and
existing tools into powerful
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)">pipelines</a> and
handle large volumes of data fast and automatically. Sequences of
commands we can save as <em>scripts</em>, which are very useful for improving
the reproducibility of workflows. Finally, the command-line is often the
easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers, just as
we will be doing during this course.</p>
<p>During the next two days, we will get familiar with the Unix shell,
which is both a command-line interface and a scripting language. We
should get familiar with how it works and how to make the best use of it
in our research. The Unix shell is the very basis for bioinformatics and
many commonly used tools and programs rely on it to various extends.
Using the shell, the beforehand mentioned task of merging fasta files
can be accomplished in just a matter of seconds!</p>
<p>Now let’s get started!</p>
