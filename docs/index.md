# Welcome to Intoduction to UNIX comand-line

This tutorial is designed for a biologist who did not have contact with a command line. At the end of this tutorial, you should get familiar with some of the basic commands which you might use daily if you end up a bioinformatician ;)  

This tutorial is part of Bioinformatics for Biologists course at FU-Berlin.
